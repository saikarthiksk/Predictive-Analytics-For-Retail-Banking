# Predictive-Analytics-For-Retail-Banking

It is important for banks to optimize the marketing strategies and
improve effectiveness. Understanding customer needs leads to
effective marketing plans and greater customer satisfaction.
In this project we will enable the bank to develop a more
understanding of it's customer base data and predicts the
customer's response and also creates a customer profile for
future marketing based on the data provided.

# Purpose

From the given data, analyzing the customer base such as age,
loan, Poutcomes, housing, job etc., the bank will be able to predict
the customer behaviors and will be able to predict which
customer is more likely to make term deposit so that the bank can
focus more on those customers.
